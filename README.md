## About Me

I am Jonathan Sage, an alpinist, poet, photographer, and software engineer. My journey spans multiple countries and disciplines, from high-altitude mountaineering in the Peruvian Andes to developing AI-driven web applications. This portfolio highlights my diverse skills and experiences.

## Projects

### Avalanche AI

A web application designed for logging snow pit, field observation, and study plot data, providing organized avalanche operations, and offering access to weather and snowpack history. The tech stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and APIs.

### Warehouse Tracker

Collaboratively developed a comprehensive full-stack Warehouse Tracker application with a team of four. This application is designed to optimize inventory management and enable real-time tracking of goods. It enhances operational efficiency by providing accurate, up-to-date information on stock levels and movement, and streamlines logistics processes through improved data visibility and reporting.

### Microsoft Hackathon

At a 24-hour Microsoft hackathon, our cross-collaborative team developed solutions to accelerate AI adoption in Canada. We built an application that enables users to learn and experiment with AI in their workflows, providing hands-on experience. Additionally, we proposed learning incentives and in-house trained Small Language Models (SLMs) to address privacy concerns and enhance trust in Microsoft's AI tools.
